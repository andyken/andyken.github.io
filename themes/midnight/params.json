{"name":"Change-inside-surroundings.vim","body":"change-inside-surroundings.vim \r\n==============================\r\n\r\nchange-inside-surroundings.vim provides two commands:\r\n\r\n* `:ChangeInsideSurrounding` (also accessible via `<leader>ci`) - this will change the contents of the innermost 'surrounding'\r\n* `:ChangeAroundSurrounding` (also accessible via `<leader>cas`) - this will change the contents as well as the surrounding characters themselves\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nVim already provides fairly easy ways to change the 'surrounding' as long\r\nas you specify the opening 'surrounding' character.  Vim also understands HTML\r\nand XML tags, so you can change inside those as well.  I wanted a _single_\r\ncommand that would intelligently just _do the right thing_.\r\n\r\n**Normal Vim can do this:**\r\n\r\nChange inside an HTML tag:\r\n\r\n* Given: `<div>London Calling</div>`\r\n* To replace the contents of the div tag I can use: `cit`\r\n\r\nChange inside curly braces:\r\n\r\n* Given: `{ death: \"or glory!\" }`\r\n* To replace the contents of the curly braces I can use: `ci{`\r\n\r\nChange inside brackets:\r\n\r\n* Given: `[ Clampdown those Spanish Bombs ]`\r\n* To replace the contents of the square brackets I can use: `ci[`\r\n\r\nChange inside quotes:\r\n\r\n* Given: `\"The Guns of Brixton\"`\r\n* `To replace the contents of the quotes I can use: <code>ci\"</code>\r\n\r\nChange-inside-surroundings.vim makes this simpler\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n`:ChangeInsideSurrounding` or `<leader>ci` will remove the contents of the innermost 'surrounding', leaving you in insert mode.\r\n\r\n`:ChangeAroundSurrounding` or `<leader>cas` will remove the entire text object, including the 'surrounding' characters, leaving you in insert mode.\r\n\r\n(Currently supported surroundings are: `{}`, `()`, `\"\"`, `><`, `[]`, `''`, \\`\\`)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf you're using [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), just\r\ncopy and paste:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\r\n    git clone git://github.com/briandoll/change-inside-surroundings.vim.git\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Brian Doll.
