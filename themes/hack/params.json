{"name":"Baby-legs","body":"### Welcome to part of the KnitHub.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to get knitters using GitHub to:\r\n\r\n* publish patterns\r\n* take pull requests for pattern fixes\r\n* encourage forking, so other knitters can create variations of patterns\r\n\r\n## Baby legwarmers\r\n\r\nOther than the scary factor of knitting in the round, baby legwarmers are an easy project. Once you get the stitches onto your needles and get a few rows done, I find it faster than knitting flat.\r\n\r\nYou need to know how to:\r\n\r\n* cast on (and get stitches onto double pointed needles or round needles)\r\n* join in the round\r\n* knit and purl\r\n* bind off\r\n* weave in ends","tagline":"Knitting pattern for baby legwarmers","google":""}
